<B>Purpose: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
 DTGEVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
 a pair of real matrices (S,P), where S is a quasi-triangular matrix
 and P is upper triangular.  Matrix pairs of this type are produced by
 the generalized Schur factorization of a matrix pair (A,B):

    A = Q*S*Z**T,  B = Q*P*Z**T

 as computed by DGGHRD + DHGEQZ.

 The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of (S,P)
 corresponding to an eigenvalue w are defined by:
 
    S*x = w*P*x,  (y**H)*S = w*(y**H)*P,
 
 where y**H denotes the conjugate tranpose of y.
 The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are computed
 directly from the diagonal blocks of S and P.
 
 This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
 eigenvectors of (S,P), or the products Z*X and/or Q*Y,
 where Z and Q are input matrices.
 If Q and Z are the orthogonal factors from the generalized Schur
 factorization of a matrix pair (A,B), then Z*X and Q*Y
 are the matrices of right and left eigenvectors of (A,B).

  Allocation of workspace:
  ---------- -- ---------

     WORK( j ) = 1-norm of j-th column of A, above the diagonal
     WORK( N+j ) = 1-norm of j-th column of B, above the diagonal
     WORK( 2*N+1:3*N ) = real part of eigenvector
     WORK( 3*N+1:4*N ) = imaginary part of eigenvector
     WORK( 4*N+1:5*N ) = real part of back-transformed eigenvector
     WORK( 5*N+1:6*N ) = imaginary part of back-transformed eigenvector

  Rowwise vs. columnwise solution methods:
  ------- --  ---------- -------- -------

  Finding a generalized eigenvector consists basically of solving the
  singular triangular system

   (A - w B) x = 0     (for right) or:   (A - w B)**H y = 0  (for left)

  Consider finding the i-th right eigenvector (assume all eigenvalues
  are real). The equation to be solved is:
       n                   i
  0 = sum  C(j,k) v(k)  = sum  C(j,k) v(k)     for j = i,. . .,1
      k=j                 k=j

  where  C = (A - w B)  (The components v(i+1:n) are 0.)

  The &quot;rowwise&quot; method is:

  (1)  v(i) := 1
  for j = i-1,. . .,1:
                          i
      (2) compute  s = - sum C(j,k) v(k)   and
                        k=j+1

      (3) v(j) := s / C(j,j)

  Step 2 is sometimes called the &quot;dot product&quot; step, since it is an
  inner product between the j-th row and the portion of the eigenvector
  that has been computed so far.

  The &quot;columnwise&quot; method consists basically in doing the sums
  for all the rows in parallel.  As each v(j) is computed, the
  contribution of v(j) times the j-th column of C is added to the
  partial sums.  Since FORTRAN arrays are stored columnwise, this has
  the advantage that at each step, the elements of C that are accessed
  are adjacent to one another, whereas with the rowwise method, the
  elements accessed at a step are spaced LDS (and LDP) words apart.

  When finding left eigenvectors, the matrix in question is the
  transpose of the one in storage, so the rowwise method then
  actually accesses columns of A and B at each step, and so is the
  preferred method.
