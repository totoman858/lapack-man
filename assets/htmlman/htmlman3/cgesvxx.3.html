<B> CGESVXX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for GE matrices</B>  
<P>

<B>Purpose: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
    CGESVXX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a
    complex system of linear equations  A * X = B,  where A is an
    N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

    If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
    are returned. CGESVXX will return a solution with a tiny
    guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
    precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
    case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
    calculated and returned.

    CGESVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
    factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
    Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
    CGESVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
    errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
    user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
    differ from what CGESVXX would itself produce.

<B>Description: </B>

<PRE>
    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:

      TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
      TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
      TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B

    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
    or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').

    2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
    the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

      A = P * L * U,

    where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower triangular
    matrix, and U is upper triangular.

    3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the
    routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
    is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
    argument RCOND). If the reciprocal of the condition number is less
    than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve for X
    and compute error bounds as described below.

    4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

    5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
    the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
    error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
    least twice the working precision.

    6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
    that it solves the original system before equilibration.

<PRE>
     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
     the PARAMS argument.

     If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
     contains the factors L and U from the factorization
     A = P*L*U as computed by CGETRF.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then
     AF is the factored form of the equilibrated matrix A.

     If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
     returns the factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
     of the original matrix A.

     If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit

     If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
     contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
     as computed by CGETRF; row i of the matrix was interchanged
     with row IPIV(i).

<I>EQUED</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
       = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
               diag(R).
       = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
               by diag(C).

<P>

<BR>

<I>R</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          R is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
     multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
     is not accessed.  R is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
     otherwise, R is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
     EQUED = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must be positive.
     If R is output, each element of R is a power of the radix.
     If R is input, each element of R should be a power of the radix
     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.

<I>C</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          C is REAL array, dimension (N)

     If C is output, each element of C is a power of the radix.
     If C is input, each element of C should be a power of the radix
     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by

<PRE>
          X is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
     If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
     system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit
     if EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
     inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', or

<P>

<BR>

<I>RCOND</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>RPVGRW</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          RPVGRW is REAL
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The &quot;max absolute element&quot;
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.  In CGESVX, this quantity is
     returned in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+WORK">WORK</A>(1).

<I>BERR</I>

          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the

<PRE>
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 &quot;Trust/don't trust&quot; boolean. Trust the answer if the

              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

<I>ERR_BNDS_COMP</I>

<PRE>
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+PARAMS">PARAMS</A>(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following

          INFO is INTEGER
       = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
         guaranteed.
       &lt; 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
       &gt; 0 and &lt;= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
         has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
         the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
         is returned.
       = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
         not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
         hand sides K with K &gt; J may not be guaranteed as well, but
         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
         componentwise error is not requested (<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+PARAMS">PARAMS</A>(3) = 0.0) then
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+PARAMS">PARAMS</A>(3) = 1.0)
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
         componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
         J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
         ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information
         about all of the right-hand sides check ERR_BNDS_NORM or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP.
