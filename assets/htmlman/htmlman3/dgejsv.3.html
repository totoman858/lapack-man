<PRE>
 DGEJSV computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real M-by-N
 matrix [A], where M &gt;= N. The SVD of [A] is written as

              [A] = [U] * [SIGMA] * [V]^t,

 where [SIGMA] is an N-by-N (M-by-N) matrix which is zero except for its N
 diagonal elements, [U] is an M-by-N (or M-by-M) orthonormal matrix, and
 [V] is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements of [SIGMA] are
 the singular values of [A]. The columns of [U] and [V] are the left and
 the right singular vectors of [A], respectively. The matrices [U] and [V]
 are computed and stored in the arrays U and V, respectively. The diagonal
 of [SIGMA] is computed and stored in the array SVA.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>JOBA</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          JOBA is CHARACTER*1
        Specifies the level of accuracy:
       = 'C': This option works well (high relative accuracy) if A = B * D,
             with well-conditioned B and arbitrary diagonal matrix D.
             The accuracy cannot be spoiled by COLUMN scaling. The
             accuracy of the computed output depends on the condition of
             B, and the procedure aims at the best theoretical accuracy.
             The relative error max_{i=1:N}|d sigma_i| / sigma_i is
             bounded by f(M,N)*epsilon* cond(B), independent of D.
             The input matrix is preprocessed with the QRF with column
             pivoting. This initial preprocessing and preconditioning by
             a rank revealing QR factorization is common for all values of
             JOBA. Additional actions are specified as follows:
       = 'E': Computation as with 'C' with an additional estimate of the
             condition number of B. It provides a realistic error bound.
       = 'F': If A = D1 * C * D2 with ill-conditioned diagonal scalings
             D1, D2, and well-conditioned matrix C, this option gives
             higher accuracy than the 'C' option. If the structure of the
             input matrix is not known, and relative accuracy is
             desirable, then this option is advisable. The input matrix A
             is preprocessed with QR factorization with FULL (row and
             column) pivoting.
       = 'G'  Computation as with 'F' with an additional estimate of the
             condition number of B, where A=D*B. If A has heavily weighted
             rows, then using this condition number gives too pessimistic
             error bound.
       = 'A': Small singular values are the noise and the matrix is treated
             as numerically rank defficient. The error in the computed
             singular values is bounded by f(m,n)*epsilon*||A||.
             The computed SVD A = U * S * V^t restores A up to
             f(m,n)*epsilon*||A||.
             This gives the procedure the licence to discard (set to zero)
             all singular values below N*epsilon*||A||.
       = 'R': Similar as in 'A'. Rank revealing property of the initial
             QR factorization is used do reveal (using triangular factor)
             a gap sigma_{r+1} &lt; epsilon * sigma_r in which case the
             numerical RANK is declared to be r. The SVD is computed with
             absolute error bounds, but more accurately than with 'A'.

<I>JOBU</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          JOBU is CHARACTER*1
        Specifies whether to compute the columns of U:
       = 'U': N columns of U are returned in the array U.
       = 'F': full set of M left sing. vectors is returned in the array U.
       = 'W': U may be used as workspace of length M*N. See the description
             of U.
       = 'N': U is not computed.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>JOBV</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          JOBV is CHARACTER*1
        Specifies whether to compute the matrix V:
       = 'V': N columns of V are returned in the array V; Jacobi rotations
             are not explicitly accumulated.
       = 'J': N columns of V are returned in the array V, but they are
             computed as the product of Jacobi rotations. This option is
             allowed only if JOBU .NE. 'N', i.e. in computing the full SVD.
       = 'W': V may be used as workspace of length N*N. See the description
             of V.
       = 'N': V is not computed.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>JOBR</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          JOBR is CHARACTER*1
        Specifies the RANGE for the singular values. Issues the licence to
        set to zero small positive singular values if they are outside
        specified range. If A .NE. 0 is scaled so that the largest singular
        value of c*A is around DSQRT(BIG), BIG=SLAMCH('O'), then JOBR issues
        the licence to kill columns of A whose norm in c*A is less than
        DSQRT(SFMIN) (for JOBR.EQ.'R'), or less than SMALL=SFMIN/EPSLN,
        where SFMIN=SLAMCH('S'), EPSLN=SLAMCH('E').
       = 'N': Do not kill small columns of c*A. This option assumes that
             BLAS and QR factorizations and triangular solvers are
             implemented to work in that range. If the condition of A
             is greater than BIG, use DGESVJ.
       = 'R': RESTRICTED range for sigma(c*A) is [DSQRT(SFMIN), DSQRT(BIG)]
             (roughly, as described above). This option is recommended.
                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        For computing the singular values in the FULL range [SFMIN,BIG]
        use DGESVJ.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>JOBT</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          JOBT is CHARACTER*1
        If the matrix is square then the procedure may determine to use
        transposed A if A^t seems to be better with respect to convergence.
        If the matrix is not square, JOBT is ignored. This is subject to
        changes in the future.
        The decision is based on two values of entropy over the adjoint
        orbit of A^t * A. See the descriptions of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?6+WORK">WORK</A>(6) and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+WORK">WORK</A>(7).
       = 'T': transpose if entropy test indicates possibly faster
        convergence of Jacobi process if A^t is taken as input. If A is
        replaced with A^t, then the row pivoting is included automatically.
       = 'N': do not speculate.
        This option can be used to compute only the singular values, or the
        full SVD (U, SIGMA and V). For only one set of singular vectors
        (U or V), the caller should provide both U and V, as one of the
        matrices is used as workspace if the matrix A is transposed.
        The implementer can easily remove this constraint and make the
        code more complicated. See the descriptions of U and V.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>JOBP</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          JOBP is CHARACTER*1
        Issues the licence to introduce structured perturbations to drown
        denormalized numbers. This licence should be active if the
        denormals are poorly implemented, causing slow computation,
        especially in cases of fast convergence (!). For details see [1,2].
        For the sake of simplicity, this perturbations are included only
        when the full SVD or only the singular values are requested. The
        implementer/user can easily add the perturbation for the cases of
        computing one set of singular vectors.
       = 'P': introduce perturbation
       = 'N': do not perturb

            sigma_max(A) overflows or if small singular values have been
            saved from underflow by scaling the input matrix A.
          - If JOBR='R' then some of the singular values may be returned

<PRE>
          LWORK is INTEGER
          Length of WORK to confirm proper allocation of work space.
          LWORK depends on the job:

          If only SIGMA is needed ( JOBU.EQ.'N', JOBV.EQ.'N' ) and
            -&gt; .. no scaled condition estimate required (JOBE.EQ.'N'):
               LWORK &gt;= max(2*M+N,4*N+1,7). This is the minimal requirement.

               is LWORK &gt;= max(2*M+N,3*N+(N+1)*NB,7). Here NB is the optimal
               block size for DGEQP3 and DGEQRF.
               In general, optimal LWORK is computed as 
               LWORK &gt;= max(2*M+N,N+LWORK(DGEQP3),N+LWORK(DGEQRF), 7).

               where NB is the optimal block size for DGEQP3, DGEQRF, DORMQR.
               In general, the optimal length LWORK is computed as

                        2*N+LWORK(DGEQRF), N+LWORK(DORMQR)). 
               Here LWORK(DORMQR) equals N*NB (for JOBU.EQ.'U') or 
               M*NB (for JOBU.EQ.'F').

  DGEJSV implements a preconditioned Jacobi SVD algorithm. It uses DGEQP3,
  DGEQRF, and DGELQF as preprocessors and preconditioners. Optionally, an
  additional row pivoting can be used as a preprocessor, which in some
  cases results in much higher accuracy. An example is matrix A with the
  structure A = D1 * C * D2, where D1, D2 are arbitrarily ill-conditioned
  diagonal matrices and C is well-conditioned matrix. In that case, complete
  pivoting in the first QR factorizations provides accuracy dependent on the
  condition number of C, and independent of D1, D2. Such higher accuracy is
  not completely understood theoretically, but it works well in practice.
  Further, if A can be written as A = B*D, with well-conditioned B and some
  diagonal D, then the high accuracy is guaranteed, both theoretically and
  in software, independent of D. For more details see [1], [2].
     The computational range for the singular values can be the full range
  ( UNDERFLOW,OVERFLOW ), provided that the machine arithmetic and the BLAS
  &amp; LAPACK routines called by DGEJSV are implemented to work in that range.
  If that is not the case, then the restriction for safe computation with
  the singular values in the range of normalized IEEE numbers is that the
  spectral condition number kappa(A)=sigma_max(A)/sigma_min(A) does not
  overflow. This code (DGEJSV) is best used in this restricted range,
  meaning that singular values of magnitude below ||A||_2 / DLAMCH('O') are
  returned as zeros. See JOBR for details on this.
     Further, this implementation is somewhat slower than the one described
  in [1,2] due to replacement of some non-LAPACK components, and because
  the choice of some tuning parameters in the iterative part (DGESVJ) is
  left to the implementer on a particular machine.
     The rank revealing QR factorization (in this code: DGEQP3) should be
  implemented as in [3]. We have a new version of DGEQP3 under development
  that is more robust than the current one in LAPACK, with a cleaner cut in
  rank defficient cases. It will be available in the SIGMA library [4].
  If M is much larger than N, it is obvious that the inital QRF with
  column pivoting can be preprocessed by the QRF without pivoting. That
  well known trick is not used in DGEJSV because in some cases heavy row
  weighting can be treated with complete pivoting. The overhead in cases
  M much larger than N is then only due to pivoting, but the benefits in
  terms of accuracy have prevailed. The implementer/user can incorporate
  this extra QRF step easily. The implementer can also improve data movement
  (matrix transpose, matrix copy, matrix transposed copy) - this
  implementation of DGEJSV uses only the simplest, naive data movement.
