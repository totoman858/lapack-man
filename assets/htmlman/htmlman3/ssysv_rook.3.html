<B>Purpose: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
 SSYSV_ROOK computes the solution to a real system of linear
 equations
    A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
 matrices.

 The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
    A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
    A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
 where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
 triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

 SSYTRF_ROOK is called to compute the factorization of a real
 symmetric matrix A using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (&quot;rook&quot;) diagonal
 pivoting method.

 The factored form of A is then used to solve the system 
 of equations A * X = B by calling SSYTRS_ROOK.

<I>UPLO</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>N</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          N is INTEGER
          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
          matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.
</PRE>

<BR>

<I>NRHS</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          NRHS is INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrix B.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

<BR>

<I>A</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
          triangular part of A is not referenced.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the block diagonal matrix D and the
          multipliers used to obtain the factor U or L from the
          factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by
          SSYTRF_ROOK.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>LDA</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          LDA is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>IPIV</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D,
          as determined by SSYTRF_ROOK.

          If UPLO = 'U':
               If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
               were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

               If IPIV(k) &lt; 0 and IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and
               columns k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and rows and
               columns k-1 and -IPIV(k-1) were inerchaged,
               D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

          If UPLO = 'L':
               If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
               were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

               If IPIV(k) &lt; 0 and IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and
               columns k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and rows and
               columns k+1 and -IPIV(k+1) were inerchaged,
               D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
</PRE>

<I>B</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
          On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>LDB</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          LDB is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>WORK</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
          On exit, if INFO = 0, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+WORK">WORK</A>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>LWORK</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          LWORK is INTEGER
          The length of WORK.  LWORK &gt;= 1, and for best performance
          LWORK &gt;= max(1,N*NB), where NB is the optimal blocksize for
          SSYTRF_ROOK.
          
          TRS will be done with Level 2 BLAS

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>INFO</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          &lt; 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          &gt; 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
               exactly singular, so the solution could not be computed.
