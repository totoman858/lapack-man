<B> ZGTSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for GT matrices  </B> 
<P>

<B>Purpose: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
 ZGTSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a complex
 system of linear equations A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,
 where A is a tridiagonal matrix of order N and X and B are N-by-NRHS
 matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.

<B>Description: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
 The following steps are performed:

 1. If FACT = 'N', the LU decomposition is used to factor the matrix A
    as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation and unit lower
    bidiagonal matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in
    only the main diagonal and first two superdiagonals.

 2. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
    returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
    to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
    reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
    INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
    to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

 3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.

          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix

          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as

          overestimate of the true error.
</PRE>

<BR>

<I>BERR</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)

          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

<P>

<BR>

<I>RWORK</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>INFO</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                &lt;= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                       has not been completed unless i = N, but the
                       factor U is exactly singular, so the solution
                       and error bounds could not be computed.
                       RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.
