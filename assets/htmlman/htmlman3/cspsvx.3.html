<B> CSPSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for OTHER matrices</B>  
<P>

<B>Purpose: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
 CSPSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization A = U*D*U**T or
 A = L*D*L**T to compute the solution to a complex system of linear
 equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix stored
 in packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<B>Description: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
 The following steps are performed:

 1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
       A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
    triangular matrices and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
    1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

 2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
    returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
    to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
    reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
    INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
    to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

 3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.

<I>B</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>LDB</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          LDB is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<PRE>
          X is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
          If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.

          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>RCOND</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          RCOND is REAL
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
          INFO &gt; 0.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>FERR</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>BERR</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

<P>

<BR>

<I>WORK</I> 
<P>

</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>RWORK</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          RWORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>INFO</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          &lt; 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                &lt;= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                       has been completed but the factor D is exactly
                       singular, so the solution and error bounds could
                       not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.

  The packed storage scheme is illustrated by the following example
  when N = 4, UPLO = 'U':

  Two-dimensional storage of the symmetric matrix A:

     a11 a12 a13 a14
         a22 a23 a24
             a33 a34     (aij = aji)
                 a44

  Packed storage of the upper triangle of A:

  AP = [ a11, a12, a22, a13, a23, a33, a14, a24, a34, a44 ]
