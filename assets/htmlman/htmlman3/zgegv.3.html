<PRE>
 This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine ZGGEV.

 ZGEGV computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right
 eigenvectors of a complex matrix pair (A,B).
 Given two square matrices A and B,
 the generalized nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem (GNEP) is to find the
 eigenvalues lambda and corresponding (non-zero) eigenvectors x such
 that
    A*x = lambda*B*x.

 An alternate form is to find the eigenvalues mu and corresponding
 eigenvectors y such that
    mu*A*y = B*y.

 These two forms are equivalent with mu = 1/lambda and x = y if
 neither lambda nor mu is zero.  In order to deal with the case that
 lambda or mu is zero or small, two values alpha and beta are returned
 for each eigenvalue, such that lambda = alpha/beta and
 mu = beta/alpha.

 The vectors x and y in the above equations are right eigenvectors of
 the matrix pair (A,B).  Vectors u and v satisfying
    u**H*A = lambda*u**H*B  or  mu*v**H*A = v**H*B
 are left eigenvectors of (A,B).

 Note: this routine performs &quot;full balancing&quot; on A and B

<PRE>
          VL is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDVL,N)
          If JOBVL = 'V', the left eigenvectors u(j) are stored
          in the columns of VL, in the same order as their eigenvalues.
          Each eigenvector is scaled so that its largest component has
          abs(real part) + abs(imag. part) = 1, except for eigenvectors
          corresponding to an eigenvalue with alpha = beta = 0, which
          are set to zero.

</PRE>

<P>

<BR>

<I>LWORK</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          LWORK is INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK &gt;= max(1,2*N).
          For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
          To compute the optimal value of LWORK, call ILAENV to get
          blocksizes (for ZGEQRF, ZUNMQR, and ZUNGQR.)  Then compute:
          NB  -- MAX of the blocksizes for ZGEQRF, ZUNMQR, and ZUNGQR;
          The optimal LWORK is  MAX( 2*N, N*(NB+1) ).

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

<PRE>
          RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (8*N)

<P>

<PRE>
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
          =1,...,N:
                The QZ iteration failed.  No eigenvectors have been
                calculated, but ALPHA(j) and BETA(j) should be
                correct for j=INFO+1,...,N.
          &gt; N:  errors that usually indicate LAPACK problems:
                =N+1: error return from ZGGBAL
                =N+2: error return from ZGEQRF

  Balancing
  ---------

  This driver calls ZGGBAL to both permute and scale rows and columns
  of A and B.  The permutations PL and PR are chosen so that PL*A*PR
  and PL*B*R will be upper triangular except for the diagonal blocks
  A(i:j,i:j) and B(i:j,i:j), with i and j as close together as
  possible.  The diagonal scaling matrices DL and DR are chosen so
  that the pair  DL*PL*A*PR*DR, DL*PL*B*PR*DR have elements close to
  one (except for the elements that start out zero.)

  After the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the balanced matrices
  have been computed, ZGGBAK transforms the eigenvectors back to what
  they would have been (in perfect arithmetic) if they had not been
  balanced.

  Contents of A and B on Exit
  -------- -- - --- - -- ----

  If any eigenvectors are computed (either JOBVL='V' or JOBVR='V' or
  both), then on exit the arrays A and B will contain the complex Schur
  form[*] of the &quot;balanced&quot; versions of A and B.  If no eigenvectors
  are computed, then only the diagonal blocks will be correct.

  [*] In other words, upper triangular form.
