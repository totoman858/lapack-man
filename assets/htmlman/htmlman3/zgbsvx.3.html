<B> ZGBSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for GB matrices</B>  
<P>

<B>Purpose: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
 ZGBSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a complex
 system of linear equations A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,
 where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals and KU
 superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.

<B>Description: </B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
 The following steps are performed by this subroutine:

 1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:
       TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
       TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
       TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
    or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').

 2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the
    matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
       A = L * U,
    where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular
    matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is upper triangular with
    KL+KU superdiagonals.

 3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
    returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
    to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
    reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
    INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
    to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

 4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.

 6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
    that it solves the original system before equilibration.

<PRE>
          FACT is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is

          equilibrated before it is factored.
          = 'F':  On entry, AFB and IPIV contain the factored form of
                  A.  If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
                  equilibrated with scaling factors given by R and C.
                  AB, AFB, and IPIV are not modified.
          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFB and factored.
          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                  copied to AFB and factored.

<PRE>
          RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix

          FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as

<I>BERR</I>

<PRE>
          BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)

<I>RWORK</I>

<PRE>
          RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
          On exit, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+RWORK">RWORK</A>(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth
          factor norm(A)/norm(U). The &quot;max absolute element&quot; norm is
          used. If <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+RWORK">RWORK</A>(1) is much less than 1, then the stability
          of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A
          could be poor. This also means that the solution X, condition
          estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR could be
          unreliable. If factorization fails with 0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then
          <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+RWORK">RWORK</A>(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor for the
          leading INFO columns of A.

<I>INFO</I> 
<P>

<PRE>
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                &lt;= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                       has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
                       singular, so the solution and error bounds
                       could not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.
